# n8n Workflows

A collection of my [n8n](https://n8n.io/) automation workflows as I explore and experiment with this powerful workflow automation tool.

## About n8n

n8n is a fair-code licensed workflow automation tool that lets you connect various services and APIs together. It's an excellent alternative to tools like Zapier or Make, with the added benefit of being self-hostable and highly customizable.
